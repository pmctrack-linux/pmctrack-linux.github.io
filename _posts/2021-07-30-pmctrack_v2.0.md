A new version of PMCTrack has been released (v2.0). The [new version][1] features, are as follows:

* Thanks to our efforts towards towards the future PMCSched scheduling framework, PMCTrack now works on top of vanilla Linux kernels (no kernel patch needed anymore). Many thanks to Lazaro Clemen for his contributions to this important enhancement of the PMCTrack tool!
* Extended functionality of the *perf* backend:
	* Now it supports Intel, AMD, ARMv7 and ARMv8 processors
	* All events provided by Perf Event's kernel subsystem are now accessible thanks to substantial improvements in the backend and on PMCTrack's user-space components
* PMCTrack support for newer kernels (latest version tested Linux v5.10.y)
* A new framework has been created for prototyping OS-level resource-management schemes (e.g., cache-partitioning strategies) within PMCTrack's kernel module. The implementation includes some sample partitioning algorithms such as UCP, LFOC and LFOC+.
